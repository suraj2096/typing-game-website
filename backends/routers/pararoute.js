       'Television is one of the many wonders of modern science and technology. It was invented in England by the Scottish scientist J.N. Baird in 1928 and the British Broadcasting Corporation was the first to broadcast television images in 1929. Previously the radio helped us hear things from far and near. spread information and knowledge from one corner of the globe to another. But all this was done through sound only. But television combined visual images with sound. Today we can watch games, shows, and song and dance programs from all corners of the world while sitting at our own homes. TV can be used for educating the masses, for bringing to us the latest pieces of information audio-visually and can provide us all kinds of entertainment even in color. But as in all things, too much televiewing may prove harmful. In many cases, the habit of watching TV has an adverse effect on the study habits of the young. When we read books, we have to use our intelligence and imagination. But in most cases, TV watching is a passive thing.',
       'Modern civilization is based upon the use of machines. For doing their workday in and day out the machines need a constant supply of energy without which they would come to a halt. Our transport systems-diesel-run railways, steamships, motor vehicles, aeroplanes-all constantly need natural fuel to keep on moving. In the last three hundred years, much of human efforts have been spent in search of the sources of energy-coal, petroleum, and power generated from water–which will maintain the present rhythm of civilization unchecked. Not only that; as the population of the world increases, the need for energy will also increase. But there is the real fear that the world reserves for energy sources of petroleum, coal, and hydel-power are gradually being exhausted.',
       'Tobacco was first discovered in America. Its cultivation on a wide scale with the help of negro-slaves made it one of the major export items in the American economy. Other parts of the world like Burma and Cuba also cultivated tobacco. Cigarettes made of tobacco rolled in tissue paper helped spread a very harmful habit among the so-called advanced countries of the West. From there it spread to different other countries of the world. Attractive packaging and expert publicity helped spread the addiction of smoking cigarettes even among the poorer sections of the people. But recently it has been detected that the habit of smoking causes different kinds of serious physical ailments, beginning with coughing, sore throat, laryngitis, asthma, and ending with such a fatal disease as cancer. Besides, for no fault of their own even persons who are liable to inhale the cigarette smoke when in the company of a smoker may suffer.',
       'The computer is one of the marvels of modern science. Its origin may be traced to the mechanical calculating machine that was invented by Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, in 1834. The machine could not fully realize the purpose that Babbage had in mind, because of the inadequate engineering skill of the time. Today’s computers are electronic. A computer can work very fast because it runs on a small current of electricity that flows at a very high speed. With the help of stored information and data, it can do calculations of very large figures within a very short time. Within seconds a computer can add, subtract, multiply and divide very large figures. Such calculations would take even an expert mathematician a much longer time to complete. Today computers are used widely in all advanced countries in data processing which means compilation, correlation, and selection of facts. In all fields of research and industry and business, the use of it.',
       'Science has done wonders in present-day civilization. It has made human life easy and comfortable In ancient days the man had to depend solely on the mercy of nature and in then society manpower was the only source for doing any laborious work. As time passed, man invented new appliances and applied new techniques to do things in every walk of life. Man has now entered the atomic era. Today he has been able to penetrate many of the mysteries of space. In some countries of the West, science has developed human society to an unimaginable extent. We cannot manufacture today even a small needle without having recourse to science. It saves both labor and time. Railways, trams, buses, ships, and airplanes have made journeys easier and quicker. Again, radios, wireless, telephones, fax, television, computer help the spread of knowledge in no time. Science has worked miracles in the branch of medicine, though its task is not yet complete. However, the achievements of science are not an unmixed blessing.',
       'No one needs to exaggerate the value of blood as a life-saving element. People suffering from diseases like leukemia and chronic anemia need a regular blood transfusion for their survival. Also, people who have lost much blood because of bleeding from wounds and injuries sustained in accidents and other violent deeds need blood to make good the lost blood. For all these emergency requirements the blood banks at government hospitals require a stock of blood from which people requiring blood may get it immediately at the critical moment. Needless to say, the healthy citizens of the country can keep these blood banks well-stocked all the time by donating blood from time to time. There may be a fear among people that regular donation of one’s blood may harm the health of the donor. But this fear is unfounded in fact; physicians assure us that the amount of blood donated is soon replenished and the donation does not have any harmful effect on the physical condition of the donor.

       'Modern life cannot be imagined without newspapers. A newspaper is a regular source of the important news of home and abroad. It represents the current and living history of the world. Newspapers are of various kinds dailies, weeklies, bi-weeklies, monthlies, etc. The main function of a daily paper is to publish news of general interest while the others mostly contain literary pieces and articles on important topics. Nowadays every newspaper has some special sections dealing with politics, everyday problems, off-beat news, business, sports, editorial page, feature pages, etc. So, the newspaper is one of the most powerful organs of dissemination of news and views among the public. It plays a very important role in educating the people and guiding them along the right path. ',
       'The phrase “Capital Punishment’ means a death sentence awarded by a court of law to someone found also on those who were found guilty of treason, serious robbery, rape, etc. Many people would support guilty of some heinous crime like murder deliberately committed. In the past, such sentence was passed capital punishment on the ground that a person who can destroy another person’s life or ruin a woman’s life by raping her is unfit to remain alive, and capital punishment is what he deserves. Besides, capital punishment also acts as a deterrent to others, who, without the fear of such extreme punishment, may commit heinous and inhuman crimes.  ',
       'Sometimes we come across some forgetful persons in our surroundings. And some geniuses are also forgetful to some extent. We know that Newton boiled his pocket watch instead of an egg. Once Einstein was traveling without a ticket in a train. When the checker demanded the ticket, he was frantically searching for the missing ticket. However, when the checker could recognize him, he assured that the scientist would not have to search for it. Einstein still went on searching and remarked that he was searching to find out where he was going for he totally forgot about his destination. But the most striking incident centered around my father on my sister’s birthday.',
       'Most of the people of our country are farmers, workers, and day laborers who live below the poverty line. But the price of essential commodities is soaring higher and higher. It has now become impossible for them to make both ends meet. It has severely hit the day laborers, the lower and middle-class families, and the salaried class too. The prices of rice, vegetables, clothes, mustard oil, medicine, and other essential commodities are also increasing by leaps and bounds. In most cases, hoarding and black marketing are responsible for such a situation. All these have made the life of the common man miserable. The government should set up more and more fair price distribution channels for selling essential commodities. The Consumers’ Forum should also be more active to check such unreasonable hikes.'
